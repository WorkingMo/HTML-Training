  <h3>YOUR VOCABULARY HAS NEEN TALKING ABOUT YOU BEHIND YOUR BACK</h3>
  <strong> The words you <u>use</u> say a lot about you.</strong> Some words say that you are smart, persuasive, and informed. Others say that you don't know what you are talking about. Knowing which words to use and understanding how to use them are keys to getting the most out of your mind.
  <p>People often say in frustration, "I know what I mean, but I don't know how to say it." If the ringht words aren't there, the right ideas can't get enough.</p>
  <p style="margin-top:40px;">Your vocabulary is the foundation of your ability to share your thoughs with other people. When you improve your vocabulary, you improve your ability to bring your intelligence to bear on the world around you.</p>
  <h3>BIGGER ISN'T NECESSARILY BETTER</h3>
  <p>When people say that someone has a "good vocabulary," they usually mean that he or she uses a lot of important-sounding words&mdash;words like <i>jactitation, demulcent,</i> and <i>saxicolous</i>. But a vocabulary consisting of words like these isn't necessarily a "good" vocabulary. <br>Why?</p>
  <p style="margin-top:22px;">Because almost no one knows what <i>jactitation, demulcent,</i> and <i>saxicolous</i> mean. If you used these words in conversation, the chances are that no one listening to you would know what you were talking about. Big, difficult words have important uses, but improving a vocabulary involves much more than merely decorating your speech or your writing with a few polysyllabic zingers.</p>

  <p>The goal of communication is clarity. We write and speak in order to make ourselves understood. A good vocabulary is one that makes communication easy and efficient. One mark of an effective speaker or writer is his or her ability to express complex ideas with relatively simple words.</p>
  <p>Most discourse among educated people is built on words that are fairly ordinary&mdash;words you've been heard before, even if you aren't exactly certain what they mean. The best way </p>
